# Cartoonifier Project
A GUI application for transforming image to a cartoon using OpenCV python library.
OpenCV is one of the library used in machine learning when dealing with computer vision,
 object detection, face recognition etcetera.
 
### To run the app
python Cartoonifier.py

# The Loan Purchase Project
The project is about Thera Bank the in which the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). 

The project was implemented using R

## Modelling process, Findings and Suggestion
The objective is to examine factors which can classify the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan based on the given data set.

We implemented four machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree without pruning, Decision Tree with pruning, Decision Tree using Ctree, Random Forest. The models were implemented using rpart, randomForest and party Package in R, and the dataset was splitted into 70% training set and 30% test set.

The performance of the trained models was evaluated on the test data set and evaluation metrics such as Accuracy and ROC curve were used. The results of the performance metrics showed that Decision Tree with pruning with accuracy of 96.8% perform better than other machine learning models. 

The LIME function was used to explain the important features of the Decision Tree with pruning locally while we used correlation analysis to gain a globalized understanding of important features of the Decision Tree with pruning model.

The suggestion to Thera Bank is to channel the retail marketing department to devise campaign toward customers with the following features; Income (Upper Middle Class), that have Certificate of Deposit Account, and worth mention Education (Advanced Professional), Average spending on credit cards. By doing this will lead to minimal budget and increasing the asset base of the bank.
